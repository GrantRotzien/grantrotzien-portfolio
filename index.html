              <p>I have been fascinated by technology since i was young. I have watched countless tech companies rise and fall as i grew up. Many companies have ceased to delve into the concepts that i would like to see carried out. So after binge watching Silicon Valley on HBO for 2 weeks straight, I decided to take it upon myself to turn my ideas into apps!</p>
