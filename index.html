    <h1>Grant Rotzien | A Portfolio</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Grant Rotzien and I aspire to be a programmer/entrepreneur in my near future. Listed below are a set of major goals i have created for myself</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Secure a position at an up-and-coming tech startup in Portland, Oregon</li>
      <li>Create an app in which background checks can be orchestrated by ordinary citizens in seconds at a reasonable price</li>
      <li>Create a music app that would cause major players in the app store, (Spotify, Soundcloud, Pandora, etc.) a run for their money</li>
      <li>Run a sucessful tech company where my employees would flourish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Background Experience</h2>
      <p>I have been fascinated by technology since i was young. I have watched countless tech companies rise and fall as i grew up. Many companies have ceased to delve into the concepts that i would like to see carried out. So after binge watching Silicon Valley on HBO for 2 weeks straight, I decided to take it upon myself to turn my ideas into apps!</p>
      <p>Listed below is a record of my background; educational, professional, etc.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Worked two and a half years at Fred Meyers</li>
        <li>Did High School online at Insight School of Washington.</li>
        <li>Using Java, I created several Minecraft servers at the age of 13.</li>
      </ul>
