    <ul>
      <li>Secure a position at an up-and-coming tech startup in Portland, Oregon</li>
      <li>Create an app in which background checks can be orchestrated by ordinary citizens in seconds at a reasonable price</li>

    <h2>Background Experience</h2>
      <p>I have been fascinated by technology since i was young. I have watched countless tech companies rise and fall as i grew up. Many companies have ceased to delve into the concepts that i would like to see carried out. So after binge watching Silicon Valley on HBO for 2 weeks straight, I decided to take it upon myself to turn my ideas into apps!</p>
